## About the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using Linux Containers ([Docker](https://docker.com/) and [Singularity/Apptainer](https://www.apptainer.org/)).

### Outline

The course will train participants to run and build Linux containers.

It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.


### Learning objectives

* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
* Build simple Docker container images

### Prerequisite / technical requirements

Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
The course materials are online on the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.

Practitioners must connect to a remote server via the "ssh" protocol during the course. You can learn about it [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work).

Those who follow the course should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, already available on the server) or an editor that can connect remotely. For the sake of information, below are the basics of "nano":
